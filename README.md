# Pulley_System

To move pulleys/weight around, click and drag the object with your mouse.

To attach ropes between hooks, pulleys, and weights, click on a green connector, and then click on another connector (do not drag mouse).

Ropes that are attached to weights must be vertical.

To interact with a completed pulley system, drag the handle knob down. 

To delete the component that you have created last, press any keyboard key.

Incomplete pulley systems will not interact.
