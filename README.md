# Pulley_System

Check out the screenshots folder for inspiration in making your own pulley system.

To move pulleys/weight around, click and drag the object with your mouse.

The purple pulley cannot be moved.

To attach ropes between hooks, pulleys, and weights, click on a green connector, and then click on another connector (do not drag mouse).

Ropes that are attached to weights must be vertical.

To interact with a completed pulley system, drag the handle knob down. 

To delete the Rope that you have attached last, press any keyboard key.

To delete a pulley, move it inside the grey recycling bin.

Incomplete pulley systems will not interact.
